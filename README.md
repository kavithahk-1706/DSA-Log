# Kavitha Haima Kidambi - DSA Log

### This repo tracks my daily progress in learning DSA using Java. Bold move, I know. 

I'm just tryna solve problems, implement algorithms, and understand their time complexities all while trying my best not to lose my mind T___T

Will I live up to it? We'll just have to see T__T
