DSA Progress Log

-> 16th July, 2025
    - Binary Search (under Algorithms/)
    - MergeSort (under Algorithms/)
    - TwoSum (under Problems/)
    - Longest Common Prefix (under Problems/)
    - Filled Square (under Logic/)
    - Hollow Square (under Logic/)

    - Important Points:
        - MergeSort does not return anything because it sorts in place
        - Binary Search is meant for SORTED ARRAYS ONLY (pls don't forget)
        - Char and String do not use the same methods 
        - Use arr.get(index) for ArrayList<> and arr[i] for arrays
        - Use str.charAt(index) for strings instead of str[index]
        - Use StringBuilder for lesser TC -> convert to String using .toString()
        - Use Arrays.toString(arr) to display arrays
        - .length for arrays, .length() for strings, and .size() for ArrayList
    
    - Note to self:
        - You did well today. Please be proud of yourself more often. And get some   sleep if you don't wanna look like a raccoon tomorrow <3
